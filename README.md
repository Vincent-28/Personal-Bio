# Personal Bio Page

This repository contains a very simple personal bio webpage built with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic understanding of front-end web development concepts such as:

- Structuring content with HTML
- Applying styling with external CSS
- Separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)

## Files
- `index.html` – the main webpage that displays my personal bio, education, experience, and skills.
- `style.css` – the stylesheet used to add colors, spacing, and layout styling.

## Goal
This project is not meant to be a full portfolio site.  
It is a learning exercise to practice and showcase the fundamentals of web development using only HTML and CSS.
